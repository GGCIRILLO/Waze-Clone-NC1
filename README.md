# Waze-Clone-NC1
Nano challenge 1

My Refined challenge statement: 
The project involves developing screens inspired by Waze to deepen my understanding of MapKit, leveraging the new functionalities introduced at WWDC23 for MapKit in SwiftUI. 
The primary goals include learning to display markers on the map, enabling users to select them, and facilitating navigation to the chosen destinations. 
Additionally, the project incorporates a personal touch with the integration of the new Lookaround feature, aiming to enhance the functionality and contribute 
a unique element to the real app. 
Honestly I struggled in finding information and documentation since this features are new so online there are few project that just show how things work in a static way, 
like with fixed positions and with everything in one view. 
I'm pretty sure that the code could be written in a more cleaner and readable way, I'm sorry for that. 
Hope you find interesting this project and maybe find this helpful for your needs ü§ûüèª.
